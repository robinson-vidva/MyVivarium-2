# Security Fixes Applied

This document describes the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the MyVivarium application.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Open Redirect Vulnerability in Login (CRITICAL - Fixed)

**Location:** `index.php` lines 198-209

**Issue:** After successful login, the redirect URL parameter was not validated, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious external sites.

**Fix:** Added validation to ensure redirect URLs are relative paths to .php files within the application:
```php
// Validate redirect URL to prevent open redirects
if (preg_match('/^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.\/\?=&]+\.php/', $rurl) && !preg_match('/^(https?:)?\/\//', $rurl)) {
    header("Location: $rurl");
    exit;
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents phishing attacks where attackers could send users malicious login links that redirect to fake sites.

### 2. Authorization Bypass in Holding Cage Edit (CRITICAL - Fixed)

**Location:** `hc_edit.php` lines 120-130

**Issue:** Users could directly access and edit any holding cage by manipulating the URL, even if they weren't assigned to that cage. The `bc_edit.php` file had proper authorization checks, but `hc_edit.php` was missing them.

**Fix:** Added authorization checks matching those in `bc_edit.php`:
```php
// Check if the logged-in user is authorized to edit this cage
$currentUserId = $_SESSION['user_id'];
$userRole = $_SESSION['role'];
$cageUsers = $selectedUsers;

if ($userRole !== 'admin' && !in_array($currentUserId, $cageUsers)) {
    $_SESSION['message'] = 'Access denied. Only the admin or the assigned user can edit.';
    header("Location: hc_dash.php?" . getCurrentUrlParams());
    exit();
}
```

**Impact:** Prevents unauthorized users from viewing or modifying cage data they shouldn't have access to.

## High Priority Issues Identified

### 3. Missing Session Cookie Security Settings (HIGH - Requires Manual Implementation)

**Location:** New file `session_config.php` created

**Issue:** Session cookies were not configured with security flags, making them vulnerable to:
- XSS attacks (session cookie theft)
- CSRF attacks
- Session hijacking over insecure connections

**Solution Created:** A new `session_config.php` file has been created with secure session configuration.

**IMPORTANT - Manual Implementation Required:**

The `session_config.php` file includes the following security settings:
- `session.cookie_httponly = 1` - Prevents JavaScript from accessing session cookies
- `session.cookie_secure = 1` - **Only sends cookies over HTTPS**
- `session.cookie_samesite = 'Strict'` - Prevents CSRF attacks
- Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Periodic session ID regeneration

**How to Implement:**

⚠️ **WARNING:** The `session.cookie_secure` setting requires HTTPS. Do NOT enable this in development environments using HTTP, as it will break sessions.

**For Production (HTTPS only):**

1. Ensure your site is running on HTTPS
2. Replace session_start() calls with:
   ```php
   require 'session_config.php';
   ```

**For Development (HTTP):**

1. Comment out the `session.cookie_secure` line in `session_config.php`:
   ```php
   // ini_set('session.cookie_secure', 1);  // COMMENT OUT FOR HTTP DEVELOPMENT
   ```
2. Then include the file as shown above

**Files that need updating (when ready to implement):**
- All files that currently call `session_start()` (35 files total)
- You can use: `grep -l "session_start()" *.php` to find them

**Alternative Approach:**
You can also add these settings to your `php.ini` file instead of using `session_config.php`.

### 4. No Session Timeout Mechanism (HIGH - Fixed in session_config.php)

**Issue:** User sessions never expired, meaning if someone left their computer unlocked, the session would remain active indefinitely.

**Fix:** The new `session_config.php` file includes:
- 30-minute inactivity timeout
- Automatic session cleanup
- Session ID regeneration every 30 minutes

This will take effect once `session_config.php` is implemented as described in issue #3 above.

## Summary

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Fixed open redirect in login flow
2. ✅ Fixed authorization bypass in hc_edit.php
3. ✅ Created session_config.php with secure settings

**Action Required:**
1. ⚠️ Implement `session_config.php` when deploying to HTTPS production environment
2. ⚠️ Test thoroughly after implementing session security changes

**Security Posture:**
- All critical SQL injection vulnerabilities: **Fixed**
- All open redirect vulnerabilities: **Fixed**
- Authorization bypass vulnerabilities: **Fixed**
- CSRF protection: **Implemented**
- File upload security: **Implemented**
- Session security: **Configuration created, awaiting deployment**

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing the session security configuration:

1. **Test session timeout:**
   - Log in and wait 31 minutes
   - Try to access a page - should be logged out

2. **Test session on HTTP (development):**
   - Ensure cookie_secure is commented out
   - Verify you can log in and navigate

3. **Test session on HTTPS (production):**
   - Enable cookie_secure setting
   - Verify login and navigation work
   - Verify cookies are only sent over HTTPS

4. **Test authorization:**
   - Try to access `hc_edit.php?id=CAGE_ID` for a cage you're not assigned to
   - Should see "Access denied" message

5. **Test open redirect protection:**
   - Try to log in with `index.php?redirect=https://evil.com`
   - Should redirect to home.php instead of external site
